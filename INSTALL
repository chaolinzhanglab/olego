OLego uses some source code from Kent (http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Getting_Started_With_Git), so the first thing you need to do is setting up the environment variable MACHTYPE. 

The following instructions are from readme file in Kent package:

-------------------------

The default MACHTYPE is often a long string: "i386-redhat-linux-gnu" which will not function correctly. It needs to be something simple such as one of:i386 i686 sparc alpha x86_64 ppc etc ... with no other alpha characters. To determine what your system reports itself as, try the uname options: 'uname -m' or 'uname -p' or 'uname -a' on your command line.  

If necessary set this environment variable. Do this under the bash shell as so:

       MACHTYPE=something
       export MACHTYPE

or under tcsh as so:

       setenv MACHTYPE something

and place this setting in your home directory .bashrc or .tcshrc environment files so it will be set properly the next time you login.  Remember to "export" it as show here for the bash shell.


--------------------------

Now you can go to the OLego directory and type:

	make

If everything goes right, you will find two executable files olegoindex and olego in the folder.

Please feel free to report any problems you come up with.
